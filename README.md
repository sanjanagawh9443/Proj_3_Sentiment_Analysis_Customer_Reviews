This project uses machine learning (Logistic Regression) to classify short text messages into **Positive** or **Negative** sentiments.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK (Stopwords)
- TF-IDF Vectorizer

## 📁 Dataset
Custom dataset created manually with positive and negative sentiments.

Example:

| Sentiment | Text |
|-----------|------|
| 1 | I love this product! It's amazing. |
| 0 | I hate this. Waste of money. |

## 🚀 Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning
2. Text Preprocessing (lowercase, punctuation, stopwords)
3. Feature Extraction using **TF-IDF**
4. Model Training using **Logistic Regression**
5. Accuracy Evaluation
6. Custom Sentiment Prediction

## 📊 Accuracy
Achieved accuracy: `90%` (on sample dataset)

## 💬 Sample Predictions
- "Fantastic product!" → **Positive**
- "Worst experience ever" → **Negative**

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Use real Twitter data with tweepy
- Add more models (Naive Bayes, SVM)
- Deploy using Flask/Streamlit
